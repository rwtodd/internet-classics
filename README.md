# Internet Classics

Sometimes I find an old story or text on the internet that's
too good not to keep. I am typesetting them here for my
personal collection.

Where possible, I will try to link to the original sources.

## Sources

 - __modern-fortran-style__: As seen on [comp.lang.fortran](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.fortran/TIYj2uhhXbU).
 - __real-programmers__: I used the copies at [http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Real+Programmers+Don%27t+Use+Pascal](http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Real+Programmers+Don%27t+Use+Pascal).
 - __tao-of-programming__: There are many copies online, but I used this one: [http://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html](http://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html).
