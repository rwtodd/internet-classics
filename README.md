# Internet Classics

Sometimes I find an old story or text on the internet that's
too good not to keep. I am typesetting them here for my
personal collection.

Where possible, I will try to link to the original sources in the list below:

## Contents

 - __bug-count-rises__: An internal 1996 Microsoft Hemingway parody contest yielded this gem of a short story. It is several places on the net, but my source was [this one](http://workpump.com/bugcount/bugcount.html).
- __degredation-flame__: An email from Bill Gates describing problems he had trying to get MovieMaker installed in 2003.  As seen in [a news blog](https://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/files/library/2003Jangatesmoviemaker.pdf).
- __every-hacker__: An essay by ESR entitled "[Things Every Hacker Once Knew](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/things-every-hacker-once-knew/)."  
 - __letwin-on-os2__: Early MS employee Gordon Letwin comments on the status of OS/2 in a frank and insightful way. As seen on [comp.os.ms-windows.misc](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!msg/comp.os.ms-windows.misc/-iNeep60eVE/Xl5ddAtJENcJ) in August of 1995.
 - __modern-fortran-style__: As seen on [comp.lang.fortran](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.fortran/TIYj2uhhXbU).
 - __parse-html-w-regex__: An amusing [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454) regarding why you should never parse HTML with
 a regex.
- __perl-postmodern__: Larry Wall's Linux World 1999 speech, a great read.  I used [this site](http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html)
 - __real-programmers__: I used the copies at [http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Real+Programmers+Don%27t+Use+Pascal](http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Real+Programmers+Don%27t+Use+Pascal).
- __sqlite-conduct__: The original SQLite Code of Conduct, based on rules given to Benedictine monks in the 6th century. This is an aspirational code, of completely different character than the typical codes of conduct one sees. After getting unwanted attention for it online, they replaced the code with something generic, but I preserved the text as seen in the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20180315125217/https://sqlite.org/codeofconduct.html).
- __tao-of-programming__: There are many copies online, but I used this one: [http://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html](http://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html).
