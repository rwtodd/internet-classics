\centerline{\bf You Can't Parse HTML with Regex}
\centerline{(amusing ``answer'' on StackOverflow)}

\bigskip

You can't parse [X]HTML with regex. Because HTML can't be parsed by
regex. Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse
HTML. As I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many
times before, the use of regex will not allow you to consume
HTML. Regular expressions are a tool that is insufficiently
sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML. HTML is
not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular
expressions. Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into
its meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me. Even
enhanced irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to
the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML is a
language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular
expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular
expressions. Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular
expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian
hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls
into the realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love,
marriage, and ritual infanticide. The $<$center$>$ cannot hold it is too
late. The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual
space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty. If you parse
HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their blasphemous ways
which doom us all to inhuman toil for the One whose Name cannot be
expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane, he comes. HTML-plus-regexp
will liquify the nerves of the sentient whilst you observe, your
psyche withering in the onslaught of horror.

{\it dear lord help us how can anyone survive this

Have you tried using an XML parser instead?
